
I originally started this as a frontend to my online image upload server. 
This is now going an IT project during the coronavirus lockdown.
Since i didnt like what we were doing in the virtual IT lessons from my school.
This is going to be a long term project and im also learning java script on the side,
as i can use js to make some interesting elements on the page.
This is mainly going to show how many pictures i have on my image server using the screenshot tool
known as ShareX, as you can have a custom uploader on it. 

This is NOT open source please DO NOT attempt to make changes
